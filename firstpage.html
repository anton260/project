             <p>Our site is aimed at creating an aesthetic and comfortable environment for human habitation. The appearance of design in the first half of the 21st century was the result of the fact that architectural creativity was separated from the elements of the real environment that were in mass production. Today, such aforementioned forms of design as architecture, design and interior are brought together as much as possible by specialists in this industry in order to be able to solve problems related to improving human life at a higher quality level. That is, we can say that the mission that the site assigns to itself is the "binding" of the subject forms of the human environment into a harmonious living space. </p>

         <h2 class="block__title text-white">Frequent mistakes in the interior</h2> 
         <p class="about__text">
           Ill-conceived layout and ergonomics of space: it all starts with a planning solution. For example: without a clear plan, real items may simply not fit into the niche for which they are intended, which is often the case with built-in appliances and furniture.
Incorrect zoning of space is manifested in the incorrect color designation of individual zones without taking into account the location of the window, door, mixing of several zones, where there is room for only one.
The selection of a suitable color scheme is a fundamental factor in a beautiful interior design in Kharkiv, as it allows you to hide planning flaws and shortcomings in the architecture of the premises in Kharkiv. "Crooked" color schemes not only spoil the freshest and most beautiful design, but also expose all design flaws.
Bust with interior decoration: for example, use parquet in the living room, laminate in the bedroom, linoleum in the hallway. A clear mix of finishing materials (this applies to both flooring and wall and ceiling finishes) will always be one of the most losing options.
Complex multi-level ceilings have long gone out of fashion: today they no longer give originality to the interior, they only hide space, “crush” and smear any beautiful interior accents.
The pursuit of trends for the sake of fashion and established stereotypes is an equally common mistake, which practically excludes one of the most important aspects of beautiful design - individuality, which should fully reflect the character, sense of beauty and the inner world of the owner of the house. The abundance of expensive branded items and fashionable art objects looks cool only at first glance, in fact, being the main indicator of bad taste and blind copying.
